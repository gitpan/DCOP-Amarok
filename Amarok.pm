=head1 NAME

DCOP::Amarok- Perl extension to speak to an amaroK object via system's DCOP.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DCOP::Amarok;
  $player = DCOP::Amarok->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a quick hack to get an interface between perl and Kde's DCOP,
since Kde3.4's perl bindings are disabled. This suite talks to 'dcop'.
DCOP::Amarok talks directly to the player object of amaroK. This is meant to be a
superclass for DcoP::Amarok::Player.
